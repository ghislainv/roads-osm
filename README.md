# Extract African roads from OpenStreetMap (OSM)

## Code

This repository includes a bash script to extract roads from Open
Street Map (OSM). Computation relies on
[`osmtools`](https://gitlab.com/osm-c-tools/osmctools) and
[`GDAL/OGR`](<http://gdal.org>) utilities.

## Results

The code produces a raster of African roads extracted from OSM. The
raster includes all types of roads (highway=*) provided by OSM. The
raster of roads has the following characteristics:

Date: July 2017. Resolution: 30m. Size: 568.56 MB. Format: GeoTIFF. Data type:
Byte. No-data value: 255. Projection: ESRI:102022 (Africa Albers Equal
Area Conic).
